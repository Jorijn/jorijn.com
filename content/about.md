{{< imgh src="me.jpg" alt="Photo of Jorijn Schrijvershof" >}}

I'm a 34-year-old developer from Brabant, The Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±. I've been dabbling
in tech from the early 2004's on, and since then, I have learned an incredible
amount about software engineering, architecture, and infrastructure.

Most of the time, I work on PHP projects using Symfony components or frameworks
like Symfony or Laravel. On occasion, I'll divert to languages like JavaScript,
NodeJS, Python, and Go as the need arises.

I've been freelancing since 2012, and I had the opportunity to work with many
great clients such as the Dutch government, Nike, Sanoma Media, and
[many more](/projects-and-references/).

When I'm not coding, I'm probably out with friends, running, or perfecting my
addiction to [Krav Maga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga).

Want to collaborate on something cool with me? [Find me here](/contact/).
